CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:14 (find_package):
  Found package configuration file:

    D:/App/QT/6.8.1/mingw_64/lib/cmake/Qt6/Qt6Config.cmake

  but it set Qt6_FOUND to FALSE so package "Qt6" is considered to be NOT
  FOUND.  Reason given by package:

  Failed to find required Qt component "SerialPort".

  Expected Config file at
  "D:/App/QT/6.8.1/mingw_64/lib/cmake/Qt6SerialPort/Qt6SerialPortConfig.cmake"
  does NOT exist



  Configuring with --debug-find-pkg=Qt6SerialPort might reveal details why
  the package was not found.

  Configuring with -DQT_DEBUG_FIND_PACKAGE=ON will print the values of some
  of the path variables that find_package uses to try and find the package.



-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
